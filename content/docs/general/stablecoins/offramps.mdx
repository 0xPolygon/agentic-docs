## Exchanges, On- and Off-ramps

Polygon is the choice for major payment projects due to the hundreds of
third-party options available on the network. Integrate with exchanges and on-
and offramps to get crypto-to-fiat exposure in 150+ countries.

## Fast, Ultra-Low Cost, Fast-finalizing Transactions

With the upgrade to Heimdall v2, deterministic finality on Polygon chain has
been sped up to between 2-5 seconds thanks to the 1-2 seconds block time in
Heimdall, meaning milestones are voted on and finalized much faster.

Fast finality means payments will be immediately available for your users.

Further, with the
[Rio upgrade](https://polygon.technology/blog/polygon-launches-major-payments-upgrade-with-rio-faster-lighter-and-easier-to-build),
the Polygon PoS network strengthens its value-proposition as a payments-first
chain by achieving **near-instant finality** and **ultra-light node
participation** while maintaining ultra-low gas costs.

The new block-production architecture — the Validator-Elected Block Producer
(VEBloP) model — elects a small pool of producers per span, which greatly
shortens block times and, crucially, eliminates chain reorganisations (reorgs).

Payments and real-world asset flows can settle with the same immediacy you'd
expect from traditional rails, but at a tiny fraction of the cost and with
significantly higher throughput. For example, Rio enables up to **5,000 tps** in
the near term.

In addition to performance, Rio dramatically lowers the cost and complexity for
infrastructure operators, which translates into lower cost for users. The
upgrade introduces stateless (witness-based) validation (PIP-72) so nodes no
longer need to store the full chain state, slashing hardware, storage and sync
time costs.

Combined with the more efficient architecture, this means lower compute burden
and the removal of reorg risk, which means a much tighter cost-base and a stronger
finality guarantee.

## Network uptime
