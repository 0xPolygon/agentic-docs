# Agent0 SDK (External)

> **Note:** This is an external tool and not developed by Polygon.

Agent0 is the TypeScript SDK for agentic economies. It enables agents to register, advertise their capabilities and how to communicate with them, and give each other feedback and reputation signals. All this using blockchain infrastructure (ERC-8004) and decentralized storage, enabling permissionless discovery without relying on proprietary catalogues or intermediaries.

## What Does Agent0 SDK Do?

Agent0 SDK v0.21 enables you to:

- **Create and manage agent identities** - Register your AI agent on-chain with a unique identity, configure presentation fields (name, description, image), set wallet addresses, and manage trust models with x402 support

- **Advertise agent capabilities** - Publish MCP and A2A endpoints, with automated extraction of MCP tools and A2A skills from endpoints

- **Enable permissionless discovery** - Make your agent discoverable by other agents and platforms using rich search by attributes, capabilities, skills, tools, tasks, and x402 support

- **Build reputation** - Give and receive feedback, retrieve feedback history, and search agents by reputation with cryptographic authentication

- **Cross-chain registration** - One-line registration with IPFS nodes, Pinata, Filecoin, or HTTP URIs

- **Public indexing** - Subgraph indexing both on-chain and IPFS data for fast search and retrieval
