description: "Identity, Reputation, and Validation registries for trustless agents"
---

**ERC-8004** defines a lightweight, on-chain trust layer for autonomous agents
using three registries - **Identity**, **Reputation**, and **Validation** -
designed to work with existing agent protocols (A2A, MCP). Payments are out of
scope for the standard; however, payment proofs (e.g., from **x402**) can be
referenced in reputation data.

**You will learn**

- What ERC-8004 is and why it exists  
- How Identity/Reputation/Validation registries fit together  
- How it complements A2A and MCP (not replaces them)  
- Where to find the **Polygon** and **Polygon Amoy** deployments and how to
  query them

## Why ERC-8004?

Modern agent stacks (e.g., Google's **A2A** for agent-to-agent coordination and
Anthropic's **MCP** for tool/data access) focus on *communication* and
*capability exposure*, not on open discovery and trust across
organizational boundaries. ERC-8004 adds that missing piece with standard
on-chain registries that any chain can host as singletons.

- **A2A** provides agent authentication, capability advertisement via *Agent
  Cards*, and orchestration; it does not standardize reputation or validation.  
- **MCP** connects LLM apps to external tools/data - it similarly leaves
  trust/discovery to applications. 
  
ERC-8004 links agents to MCP/A2A endpoints through an on-chain identity, with
optional trust signals.

---

## What ERC-8004 standardizes (at a glance)

- **Identity Registry** - an **ERC-721 + URIStorage** registry that mints an
  *Agent ID* (`agentId`) and points its `tokenURI` to a JSON registration file
  (e.g., on IPFS/HTTPS) listing A2A/MCP endpoints, DIDs, ENS, wallets, etc.
  Ownership of the NFT = ownership of the agent entry.
- **Reputation Registry** - an interface for clients to submit **feedback**
  (score `0-100`, optional tags, and an optional off-chain file/URI + hash).
  Off-chain files may include **payment proofs** to correlate economics with
  feedback.  
- **Validation Registry** - a request/response log for **independent
  validators** (e.g., stake-based re-execution, zkML verifiers, TEEs) to post
  attestations about an agent's work. Results can be queried on-chain.

<Callout type="note" title="Orthogonality"> Payments are **orthogonal** to
ERC-8004; the spec shows how **x402** proofs can be referenced in reputation
data but does not dictate any settlement flow. </Callout>

## Polygon deployments

### Amoy

- **IdentityRegistry:** [0x8004ad19E14B9e0654f73353e8a0B600D46C2898](https://amoy.polygonscan.com/address/0x8004ad19E14B9e0654f73353e8a0B600D46C2898)
- **ReputationRegistry:** [0x8004B12F4C2B42d00c46479e859C92e39044C930](https://amoy.polygonscan.com/address/0x8004B12F4C2B42d00c46479e859C92e39044C930)
- **ValidationRegistry:** [0x8004C11C213ff7BaD36489bcBDF947ba5eee289B](https://amoy.polygonscan.com/address/0x8004C11C213ff7BaD36489bcBDF947ba5eee289B)

Polygon mainnet is coming soon.

## Minimal examples (read-only)

> Below are deterministic, read-only snippets using `viem`. They assume the
> Amoy addresses above and will work even before you mint/register agents -
> though `tokenURI/ownerOf` will only resolve for existing `agentId`s.

```ts
import { createPublicClient, http } from "viem";
import { polygonAmoy } from "viem/chains";
import "dotenv/config";

const IDENTITY = "0x8004ad19E14B9e0654f73353e8a0B600D46C2898" as const;
const REPUTATION = "0x8004B12F4C2B42d00c46479e859C92e39044C930" as const;
const VALIDATION = "0x8004C11C213ff7BaD36489bcBDF947ba5eee289B" as const;

const erc721View = [
  { type: "function", name: "name", stateMutability: "view", inputs: [], outputs: [{ type:"string" }] },
  { type: "function", name: "symbol", stateMutability: "view", inputs: [], outputs: [{ type:"string" }] },
  { type: "function", name: "tokenURI", stateMutability: "view", inputs: [{ type:"uint256" }], outputs: [{ type:"string" }] },
];

const validationView = [
  { type:"function", name:"getValidationStatus", stateMutability:"view",
    inputs:[{type:"bytes32"}],
    outputs:[{type:"address"},{type:"uint256"},{type:"uint8"},{type:"bytes32"},{type:"uint256"}] },
];

async function main() {
  const pub = createPublicClient({ chain: polygonAmoy, transport: http() });

  // Identity registry metadata
  const name = await pub.readContract({ address: IDENTITY, abi: erc721View, functionName: "name" });
  const symbol = await pub.readContract({ address: IDENTITY, abi: erc721View, functionName: "symbol" });
  console.log({ name, symbol }); // e.g., "Agent Identity", "AGNT"

  // Sample agentId=1 (will throw if not yet minted)
  // const uri = await pub.readContract({ address: IDENTITY, abi: erc721View, functionName: "tokenURI", args:[1n] });
  // console.log({ uri });

  // Check a validation status by requestHash (bytes32)
  // const reqHash = "0x" + "00".repeat(32) as `0x${string}`;
  // const status = await pub.readContract({ address: VALIDATION, abi: validationView, functionName: "getValidationStatus", args:[reqHash] });
  // console.log({ status });
}
main();
```

### Where these come from in the spec

- Identity uses ERC-721 + URIStorage (hence tokenURI and ownership semantics). 
- Validation exposes getValidationStatus/getSummary to query results.

<Callout type="note" title="Future proofing and backwards compatibility">
You can use more
[modern interfaces and standards backwards compatible with ERC-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6220)
to access the same values if you wish.
</Callout>

### How it fits with A2A, MCP, and x402

A2A (Agent-to-Agent) remains the coordination layer (auth, agent cards,
lifecycle). ERC-8004 adds discovery + trust so agents from different orgs can
find and assess each other.

MCP remains the tool/data layer. The ERC-8004 Identity record can link to MCP
endpoints so agent wallets or marketplaces can enumerate capabilities
consistently.

x402 stays the payment layer. ERC-8004 is payment-agnostic; you can optionally
embed payment proofs (e.g., x402 tx hashes) in off-chain feedback files
referenced by the Reputation registry.

## Design goals and recent status

ERC-8004 is an ERC (Standards Track) proposal created Aug 13, 2025, currently
under public review.

It introduces pluggable trust models (reputation, crypto-economic validation,
zk/TEE attestations) with security proportional to value at risk - from casual
tasks to high-stakes use cases. The registries are intended to be per-chain
singletons for straightforward discovery.

Community discussion continues (e.g., handling on-chain vs off-chain data,
encouraging multiple independent reputation providers, and keeping payments
decoupled while allowing payment proofs to be referenced).

The bulk of development discussion is happening in the Telegram group
[ERC-8004 Builders](https://t.me/ERC8004) or the
[Magicians forum thread](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/erc-8004-trustless-agents/25098).
