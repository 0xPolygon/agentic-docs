x402 is an open payment protocol that brings blockchain payments into a familiar
web standard. By re-using the HTTP 402 Payment Required status code, it lets
developers handle on-chain and agentic payments with the same tools they already
use for APIs and web services.

Instead of building complex wallet integrations or subscription systems,
developers can simply treat payments like another part of the HTTP
request/response cycle. This lowers the barrier for web2 developers
experimenting with web payments, while also giving web3 builders a lightweight
way to support pay-per-use APIs, agent-to-agent transactions, and micropayments.

## Access on Polygon

Polygon currently supports x402 on Mainnet and Amoy through the following facilitators:

1. Polygon Mainnet Facilitator: https://x402.polygon.technology
2. Polygon Testnet Facilitator: https://x402-amoy.polygon.technology
3. [ThirdWeb](https://playground.thirdweb.com/payments/x402)
4. [x402.rs Facilitator Endpoint](https://facilitator.x402.rs/)
5. [Pay.AI](https://payai.network/)
6. [Corbits](https://docs.corbits.dev/about-x402/facilitators)
7. [Questflow](https://facilitator.questflow.ai/)


To implement x402 with Polygon and your applications or agents, follow our
tutorials and guides in these docs. Alternatively, the x402 community has
created
[multiple examples](https://github.com/coinbase/x402/tree/main/examples/typescript)
which can be easily adapted for Polygon.
