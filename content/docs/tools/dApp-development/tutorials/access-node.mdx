If you're a new Web3 developer, it's unlikely that you'll need to run your own full node on Polygon.

The majority of developers use a node provider, or a third-party external service that receives node requests and returns responses for you automatically. That's because the fastest way to get developing on Polygon is using a node provider rather than managing your own node.

This guide demonstrates how to connect to a RPC provider, using Alchemy as an example.

## Send your first blockchain request

This guide assumes you already have an [Alchemy account](https://alchemy.com/?r=e68b2f77-7fc7-4ef7-8e9c-cdfea869b9b5) and access to the [Alchemy Dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemyapi.io).

### Create an Alchemy key

First, you'll need an Alchemy API key to authenticate your requests. You can [create API keys from the dashboard](http://dashboard.alchemyapi.io). Check out [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfggWxfG9o0) on how to create an app. Or you can follow the steps written below:

1. Navigate to the **Create App** button in the **Apps** tab.

2. Fill in the details under **Create App** to get your new key. You can also see the applications you previously made by you and your team on this page. Pull existing keys by clicking on **View Key** for any app.

You can also pull existing API keys by hovering over **Apps** and selecting one. You can **View Key** here, as well as **Edit App** to whitelist specific domains, see several developer tools, and view analytics.

### Making a cURL request

You can interact with Alchemy's Polygon infrastructure provider using JSON-RPC and your [command line interface](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/c/commandi.htm).

For manual requests, use `POST` requests to interact with the JSON-RPC. Simply pass in the `Content-Type: application/json` header and your query as the `POST` body with the following fields:

* `jsonrpc`: The JSON-RPC version—currently, only `2.0` is supported.
* `method`: The MATIC API method. [See API reference](https://alchemyenterprisegroup.readme.io/reference/polygon-api-quickstart).
* `params`: A list of parameters to pass to the method.
* `id`: The ID of your request. Will be returned by the response so you can keep track of which request a response belongs to.

#### Example request

```bash
curl https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/jsonrpc/demo \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":73,"method":"eth_gasPrice","params":[]}'
```

<Callout type="info">

In case you want to send requests to your own app instead of our public demo, replace `https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/jsonrpc/demo` with your own API key `https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/your-api-key`.

</Callout>

Results:

```json
{ "id": 73,
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": "0x09184e72a000" // 10000000000000 }
```

## Alchemy SDK setup

To make blockchain requests directly from your Javascript / Node.js dApp, you'll need to integrate the *Alchemy SDK*, the easiest and most powerful way to access the blockchain and Alchemy's suite of enhanced APIs.

*If you have an existing client such as Web3.js or Ethers.js,* you can just change your current node provider URL to an Alchemy URL with your API key: `https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/your-api-key`

The scripts below need to be run in a **node context** or **saved in a file**, not run from the command line.

</Callout>

### Install the Alchemy SDK

To install the Alchemy SDK, you want to create a project, and then navigate to your project directory to run the installation. Let's go ahead and do that! Once we're in our home directory, let's execute the following:

With Yarn:

```bash
mkdir your-project-name
cd your-project-name
yarn init # (or yarn init --yes)
yarn add alchemy-sdk
```

With NPM:

```bash
mkdir your-project-name
cd your-project-name
npm init   # (or npm init --yes)
npm install alchemy-sdk
```

### Create `index.js`

```js
import { Alchemy, Network } from "alchemy-sdk";

const settings = {
  apiKey: "demo", // Replace with your Alchemy API key.
  network: Network.ETH_MAINNET, // Replace with your network.
};

const alchemy = new Alchemy(settings);

async function main() {
  const gasPrice = await alchemy.core.getGasPrice();
  console.log(gasPrice.toString());
}

main();
```

### Run

```bash
node index.js
```
