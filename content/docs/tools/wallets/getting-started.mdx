This page introduces Polygon-compatible wallets and how to choose one.

<Callout type="warn" title="Third-party wallets">

Do your own due diligence before using third party wallets. The official Polygon Support _cannot_ provide assistance for issues with these wallets or other non-native wallets.

</Callout>

[Ethereum.org's wallet documentation page](https://ethereum.org/en/wallets/) has a comprehensive page of different wallets you can select from. There are many options to filter the list to find a wallet that is right for you including:

- Device type: browser plugin, desktop, mobile, or hardware wallet.
- Security: open source, personal ownership/custody of your wallet.
- Language support: filter by your preferred language.

Be sure to select **Layer 2** on the Filter menu on the left side of the page to list wallets that are compatible with Polygon networks.

## Polygon portal

The [Polygon Portal](https://portal.polygon.technology) is a comprehensive solution for account management on Polygon.

The Portal can be used to perform a variety of tasks, such as:

- Bridge your assets via the [Polygon native bridge](https://support.polygon.technology/support/solutions/articles/82000905011-how-does-bridging-work-) and a variety of third-party bridges.
- View token balances across supported networks.
- Monitor bridging transactions.
