## Steps to submit a mapping request

1. To submit a request for mapping your token on Polygon PoS, start by navigating to [the Google form available here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeq8HTef2dYpRx35_WWYhyr4C146K9dfhyYJQcoD1RuTTVABg/viewform).

2. Choose a **Network** option depending upon the chain on which you're looking to map your token. This would be **Sepolia ↔ Polygon Amoy** for testnet, and **Ethereum ↔ Polygon PoS** for mainnet.

3. Next, input the contract address for the token contract that you've deployed on Sepolia/Ethereum mainnet in the **Root Contract Address (L1)** field.

4. Choose the correct **Token Type** for your token. i.e., [ERC-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) for a standard token, [ERC-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) for an NFT, or [ERC-1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155) for a multi token.
